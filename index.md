## Lab Purpose and Components
This week was where students began working with GitHub, so lab 7 was about learning the basics.

## What I Learned
The lab for week 7 was fairly simple, but it helped me ease my way into GitHub, which is so vast that anything faster would've been most likely too much to take in.
